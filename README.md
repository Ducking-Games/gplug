A godot addon written in pure GDScript for managing out-of-band (non-assetlib) addons in Godot 4.3+

Ever dealt with an addon that wasn't in asset-lib, required a compatibility branch, or you need latest versions?

GPlug attempts to solve this by managing the integration and updates of addons not managed by asset-lib. 

GPlug is a revision of Godotons.
